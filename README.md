An experimental SPA built with Vanilla JS!

## Demo

https://silvester-pari.github.io/vanilla-site/

## Experiment goals

- no dependencies
- as few files/lines of code as possible
- using as many modern JS features as possible

## FAQ

### No dependencies? Really?

Yes! Ah wait... maybe? You probably will want some styling framework or markdown rendering etc., so you could add some! The example (in the `example` folder) uses [Pico](https://picocss.com/) for some minimal styling.

### Can I use this in production?

Probably not. There are much better and robust frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/) etc.

### How do I start the dev server?

There is no dev server! Just run the example in the `/example` folder (e.g. `npx http-server ./example/`).

### How do I bundle this?

No bundling, just Vanilla.

### Can I contribute?

Sure, feel free!
